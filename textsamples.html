<div class="surprising">
<p>There’s a reason the text you’re reading now is not pure black (#000000), and the background is not pure white (#FFFFFF). It’s because many dyslexic users are sensitive to the brightness the high contrast colors cause. This can cause the words to swirl or blur together [3].
<p>To avoid this, use an off-white color for your background, like light gray or tan. You can also use a dark gray for your text instead of pure black to cut the glare even more.

[it is in fact #4c4c4c on white]
<h2>[3] above is 2002's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020810191014/http://www.dyslexia-parent.com/mag35.html">Designing web pages for dyslexic readers</a></h2>
<div class="dyslexia-parent"><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Background color</b>
<p>Many dyslexic readers are particularly sensitive to the brightness of text on a pure white background. This can cause the words to appear to move around and to blur together. 
<p>This difficulty can be avoided if pure white is not used for the page background color. A slightly off-white color can easily be achieved (with the code BGCOLOR="#FFFFFC"). Text is also harder to read on a patterned or tiled background.
<p>For pages which are heavily used by dyslexic adults or teenagers, a backgound color changer can be added to a page, like the one at the top of this page (which may be freely copied by any other web designer).</font>
